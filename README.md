# The Future of AI Design: Unlocking Multi-Agent Capabilities with Azure

**Problem**: Agentic AI systems are set to transform the way businesses operate, however it can be fairly complex to build an initial MVP to demonstrate this value.

**Solution**: The Multi-Agent-Custom Automation Engine Solution Accelerator provides a ready to go application to use as the base of the MVP, or as a reference, allowing you to hit the ground running.

## Important Security Notice

This template, the application code and configuration it contains, has been built to showcase Microsoft Azure specific services and tools. We strongly advise our customers not to make this code part of their production environments without implementing or enabling additional security features.


## Features
This application demonstrates the following concepts and how to implement them:

- How to build a highly scalable, multi-tenant & user, RAG Pattern application.
- Generating embeddings and completions.
- Managing a context window (chat history) for natural conversational interactions with an LLM.
- Manage per-request token consumption for Azure OpenAI Service requests.
- Building a semantic cache for improved performance and cost.
- Implementing full-text and hybrid search using Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To successfully complete this hackathon, you will need the following:

1. GitHub account to access the repository and run [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
2. Familiarity with Python programming, including making API calls.
3. The user deploying the template must have permission to create resources and resource groups.
4. Ability to provision Azure Container Application, Azure OpenAI and Azure Cosmos DB resources.

To start this hackathon, please follow the guidelines starting from Lab 0 throguh Lab 3, or automatically jump to the Lab 2 for implementation of the Multi Agent Accelerator

## Challenges
Challenge 0: **[Deployment of Resources in Azure](Challenge0/readme.md)**

Challenge 1:  **[Building your first agent](Challenge1/readme.md)**
