## Lab 1 - Build your First Multi-Agent

**Expected Duration:** 30 minutes


## Use Case: Personalized Travel Planning System

![alt text](image.png)

The AI system you are building is designed to offer a highly personalized and efficient travel planning and experience management service. The system leverages a series of specialized agents working in tandem to provide tailored travel itineraries, insightful local guidance, and visually enriched content for users. Each agent in the system has a distinct role, contributing to an end-to-end service that addresses the unique needs of modern travelers.

Here's a comprehensive list of the "Team" you will be working with:


| Role                    | Agent Type           | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BOSS                    | [UserProxyAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.UserProxyAgent)       | User agent who provides the inputs and queries                              |
| Travel Planner          | [AssistantAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.AssistantAgent)        | Provides personalized itineraries, booking recommendations, cost optimization, and real-time travel insights |
| Local Tourist Guide     | [AssistantAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.AssistantAgent)       | Provides personalized recommendations, historical insights, hidden gems, and real-time navigation tips to enhance the traveler’s experience in Seattle location |
| Prompt Agent            | [AssistantAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.AssistantAgent)        | Creates a Image Generation Prompt for the itinerary created by Travel Planner and Local Tourist Guide |
| Dalle Image Creation Agent | ConversableAgent   | Generates Images based on the prompt created by Prompt Agent                |


As in typical travel agencies, your **Agents will also communicate with eachother**. For example, the Image generated by the Dalle Image Creation Agent will be generated base on the itinerary defined by the user.

The system combines these agents to deliver a seamless, tailored travel experience that includes itinerary planning, local insights, and visual content, all aimed at enriching the user's journey.

Please find more documentation needed for understanding autogen agents in the end of this Lab.

## Exercise 1: Basic Infrastructure Setup : Azure + Local

To start this first demo, we will use the resources that have been deployed for the following exercises. We will use the `gpt4-o`and `dalle-3` models inside the Azure OpenAI Service to help our agents perform their actions. 


## Exercise 2 : Coding and understanding Multi-Agent Multimodal setup
In this exercise we will learn how to code multi-agent, multi-modal solution and run it locally.
>Step 1: Configuration import for models
>1. Open **LabCode.ipynb** file in VS code.
>2. Assign the **configuration** to the respective config variables by copy and pasting the code below in the placeholder provided.
>```python-linenums
>llm_config_dalle3 = {"config_list": config_list_dalle3, "timeout": 60, "temperature": 0.7, "seed": 5678}
>llm_config_gpt4 = {"config_list": config_list_gpt4, "timeout": 60, "temperature": 0.7, "seed": 5678}
>```

>Step 2: Initialize the User Proxy Agent - Boss
>1. In this step, you will **initialize** the **boss** agent required for the travel itinerary. The Boss agent is a UserProxyAgent that represents the user requesting a Seattle outing plan in February.
>
>Copy and paste the following code.
>```python-linenums
>boss = UserProxyAgent(
>name="Boss",
>is_termination_msg=termination_msg,
>human_input_mode="ALWAYS",
>code_execution_config=False,
>default_auto_reply="Reply `TERMINATE` if the task is done.",
>description="User requesting a Seattle outing plan in February."
>)
> ```

>Step 3: Give the system message for planner agent

1. The **Tour_Planner_Agent** is an AssistantAgent specializing in creating personalized travel itineraries. It provides tailored recommendations based on user preferences, budget, and travel dates.

    Copy and paste the following code.
    ````    
    system_message = """ You are a smart, personable, and proactive Tour Planner Agent specializing in creating personalized travel itineraries and experiences for users. Your primary goal is to provide tailored recommendations for destinations, accommodations, local attractions, restaurants, and transportation options based on the user preferences, budget, and travel dates. Use the following guidelines to assist users effectively:


    Ask for user preferences such as travel style (e.g., adventure, luxury, budget-friendly), favorite activities, or special interests (history, nature, culture, etc.).
    Consider weather, local events, and safety advisories when making recommendations.
    Destination Knowledge:

    Provide relevant information about destinations, including must-visit attractions, hidden gems, and local customs.
    Suggest best times to visit based on seasons, festivals, or unique experiences.
    Travel Planning:

    Help create detailed itineraries with activity suggestions, transit times, and tips for efficient travel.

    Budget and Deals:

    Recommend cost-effective options or luxury upgrades based on the user budget.
    Share insights on travel packages, discounts, or local savings cards where applicable.
    Contextual Awareness:

    If the user mentions specific travel constraints or goals (e.g., eco-friendly travel, solo trips, family-friendly), incorporate them into suggestions.
    Engagement:

    Use a friendly, conversational tone to build excitement and maintain a helpful demeanor.
    Clarify any questions and follow up with personalized solutions or refined plans as needed.
    Examples of user inquiries you should handle:

    "Plan a 7-day adventure trip to New Zealand for under $3,000."
    "Recommend family-friendly activities in Paris in April."
    "Suggest a luxury honeymoon itinerary for 10 days in Greece."
    Remember, your mission is to make trip planning stress-free, engaging, and uniquely tailored to every traveler’s dream journey. Enjoy planning the perfect travel experience!""",
