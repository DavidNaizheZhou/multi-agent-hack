The AI system you are building is designed to offer a highly personalized and efficient travel planning and experience management service. The system leverages a series of specialized agents working in tandem to provide tailored travel itineraries, insightful local guidance, and visually enriched content for users. Each agent in the system has a distinct role, contributing to an end-to-end service that addresses the unique needs of modern travelers.

As in typical travel agencies, your **Agents will also communicate with eachother**. For example, the Image generated by the Dalle Image Creation Agent will be generated base on the itinerary defined by the user.

The system combines these agents to deliver a seamless, tailored travel experience that includes itinerary planning, local insights, and visual content, all aimed at enriching the user's journey.

Here's a comprehensive list of the "Team" you will be working with:


| Role                    | Agent Type           | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BOSS                    | [UserProxyAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.UserProxyAgent)       | User agent who provides the inputs and queries                              |
| Travel Planner          | [AssistantAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.AssistantAgent)        | Provides personalized itineraries, booking recommendations, cost optimization, and real-time travel insights |
| Local Tourist Guide     | [AssistantAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.AssistantAgent)       | Provides personalized recommendations, historical insights, hidden gems, and real-time navigation tips to enhance the travelerâ€™s experience in Seattle location |
| Prompt Agent            | [AssistantAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.AssistantAgent)        | Creates a Image Generation Prompt for the itinerary created by Travel Planner and Local Tourist Guide |
| Dalle Image Creation Agent | [ConversableAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/migration-guide.html#conversable-agent-and-register-reply)   | Generates Images based on the prompt created by Prompt Agent                |

Please find more documentation needed for understanding autogen agents in the end of this Lab.

## Exercise 1: Basic Infrastructure Setup : Azure + Local

To start this first demo, we will use the resources that have been deployed for the following exercises. We will use the `gpt4-o`and `dalle-3` models inside the Azure OpenAI Service to help our agents perform their actions. 

## Exercise 2: Running your first agent

Please jump over to the multiagent101.ipynb file to complete this guide. In the end of your notebook, you will be prompted to as the BOSS agent coordinate these teams. Please make sure to try out several prompts, including the ones that will trigger the image creation of your Seattle trip.

## **Conclusion**

**Congratulations!** You have completed this exercise. In this exercise, you learned how to set up and use autogen agents to create a travel itinerary for Vienna in March. Make sure to save your work and review the concepts covered. Now that you know the basics of Multi-Agent Systems, let's dive into more complex frameworks.
