# The Future of AI Design: Unlocking Multi-Agent Capabilities with Azure

Agentic AI systems have the potential to transform the way businesses operate, but building an MVP to demonstrate this value can be challenging. This guide will walk you through the key components of multi-agent systems, and provide you with an Accelerator featuring a ready-to-go application. Whether you use it as the foundation for your MVP or as a reference, this will help you hit the ground running and fast-track your development.

## ‚ú® Features
This repo demonstrates the following concepts and how to implement them:
- Orchestration of specialized AI agents
- Agent-to-agent communication patterns
- Complex workflow management
- Cosmos DB for persistence
- Application Insights monitoring
- GitHub Codespaces for instant development environment setup
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Azure Bicep/ARM templates
- Structured logging and telemetry

 

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To successfully complete this hackathon, you will need the following:

1. GitHub account to access the repository and run [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
2. Familiarity with Python programming, including making API calls.

To start this hackathon, please follow the guidelines starting from Challenges 0 through Challenges 3.
### Deploying Azure OpenAI supported regions

This template uses gpt-4o, dalle3 and text-embedding-3-large models by default using the Sweden Central region. If this region is not your preferred, please consider the models may not be available in all Azure regions. Check for [up-to-date region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models) and select a region during deployment accordingly.


### Checking Azure OpenAI quota limits

For this sample to deploy successfully, there needs to be enough Azure OpenAI quota for the models used by this sample within your subscription. This sample deploys a new Azure OpenAI account with two models, **gpt-4o with 10K tokens** per minute and **text-3-large with 5k tokens** per minute. For more information on how to check your model quota and change it, see [Manage Azure OpenAI Service Quota](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/quota)

### Azure Subscription Permission Requirements

This solution deploys [user-assigned managed identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) and defines then applies Azure Cosmos DB RBAC permissions to this identity. At a minimum you will need the following Azure RBAC roles assigned to your identity in your Azure subscription or [Subscription Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/privileged#owner) access which will give you both of the following.

- [Manged Identity Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/identity#managed-identity-contributor)
- [DocumentDB Account Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/databases#documentdb-account-contributor)

## üèãÔ∏è Challenges


Challenge 0: [Deployment of Resources in Azure](Challenge0/readme.md)
- Deploy and configure the necessary Azure resources, including the AI services that will be used throughout the hackathon, ensuring a solid foundation for the upcoming tasks and enabling seamless execution of the subsequent challenges.

Challenge 1:  [Building your first Multi-Agent](Challenge1/readme.md)

- A step-by-step guide on creating your own Travel Agency Agents: create a team composed of several planners, guides and marketing professionals to create a personalized travel with tailored itineraries, local guidance, whilst delivering enriched content to your customers.


Challenge 2:  [Expand Your Multi-Agent Capabilities](Challenge2/readme.md)

Now that you know the basics of Multi-Agent scenarios, it's time to build your own!We'll start by using the MACAE app that will aid you on having the basic setup created. Then, this open-ended exercise will guide you through the customization path your MVP needs. 

Challenge 3: [Advancing Real-World Applications](Challenge3/readme.md)



Each challenge comes with its own set of tasks and objectives. Feel free to explore the challenges, learn, and have fun during this hackathon! 
## üí∞ Costs

You can estimate the cost of this project's architecture with [Azure's pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) 
Please use this [link](https://azure.com/e/c5b4707661814dd787c3a83cbcf51be5) for an example in $USD, in Sweden Central of the price of the sample MVP:

Average Monthly Cost:
* Azure Cosmos DB Standard provisioned throughput ($0.25 USD per 1M RU/s): $5,84
* Azure App Service (B1 Plan): $13.14
* Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o 1M input/output tokens): $12,50 (Sample uses 10K tokens)
* Azure OpenAI (text-3-large - 1M tokens):  $0.13 (Sample uses 5K tokens)
* Azure Application Insights - FREE for the first 3 months, after that 1GB x 30 days - $74,75 (Sample uses 0,001 GB)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notice

This template, the application code and configuration it contains, has been built to showcase Microsoft Azure specific services and tools. We strongly advise our customers not to make this code part of their production environments without implementing or enabling additional security features.
